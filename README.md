# Rect Extensions

Read about `RextEx` on [habr](https://habr.com/post/340858/) (ru).
Extended docs at [Documentation](./Documentation/st.rect-ex.md) folder (according to [Unity Package Layout](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html)). 

RectEx is a tool that simplify drawing EditorGUI (not *Layout*) elements with [Unity3d](https://unity3d.com). 

RectEx consists of a bunch of `Rect` extensions, which provides an interface to work with rects easier.

Stop doing 

```csharp
rect.height = 18;
GUI.LabelField(rect, "First line");
rect.y += rect.height;
GUI.LabelField(rect, "Second line");
rect.y += rect.height;
rect.width = (rect.width - 5) / 2;
GUI.LabelField(rect, "Third line: left part");
rect.x += rect.width + 5;
GUI.LabelField(rect, "Third line: right part");
```

Use **Column** and **Row** instead:

```csharp
using RectEx;
```
```csharp
var rects = rect.Column(3);
GUI.LabelField(rects[0], "First line");
GUI.LabelField(rects[1], "Second line");

rects = rects[2].Row(2);
GUI.LabelField(rects[0], "Third line: left part");
GUI.LabelField(rects[1], "Third line: right part");
```

# Why do you need it?

Because you don't want to get lost among all these `rect.y += rect.height` and `rect.width = (rect.width - 5) / 2`.

Because you want to draw your GUI elements easily and feel yourself comfortable.

Because you want to make your code readable.

Because you aren't afraid of trying new awesome things, are you?
